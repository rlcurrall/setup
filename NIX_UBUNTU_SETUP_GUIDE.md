# Guide: Building a Declarative Ubuntu Setup with Nix

This document outlines a strategy to refactor your current Nix-based Ubuntu setup into a robust, modular, and declarative system. It uses your excellent `nix-darwin` Mac setup as a blueprint and combines its principles with the modularity of the Omakub project.

## 1. The Goal: Parity with Your Mac Setup

Your Mac setup is the gold standard. Its "completeness" comes from using `nix-darwin` to declaratively manage the entire system. Our goal is to replicate this experience on Ubuntu as closely as possible.

- **The `nix-darwin` Analogy:** On macOS, you have `nix-darwin`. The equivalent for a Linux distribution is `NixOS`. Since you are on Ubuntu, we will use **Home Manager** as our primary tool. While it can't manage the OS kernel, it gives us powerful control over your entire user environment, which is where most customization happens.
- **The `homebrew` Cask Analogy:** Your Mac setup pragmatically uses Homebrew Casks for GUI applications. We will achieve the same result on Ubuntu by using **Flatpak**, managed declaratively through Nix. This is the best-in-class solution for Linux GUI apps.
- **Improving on the Monolithic Flake:** Your Mac `flake.nix` is comprehensive. We can make the Ubuntu version even more maintainable by splitting it into logical modules, an idea borrowed from the clean structure of Omakub.

## 2. Proposed Architecture

We will restructure your configuration to be modular, fully declarative, and mirror the capabilities of your Mac setup.

### A. A Single, Simple Installer

Your installation script will do only three things: install Nix, clone your `.setup` repo, and run Home Manager. All complexity moves into Nix.

### B. Modular Flake Configuration

Just as Omakub has `install/terminal` and `install/desktop`, we will split your `flake.nix` into logical modules.

```
ubuntu/
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.nix       # Main flake, imports modules
â”œâ”€â”€ home.nix        # Core user settings, shell, CLI tools (like your mac's home-manager section)
â”œâ”€â”€ gnome.nix       # All GNOME settings, keybindings, themes, and dock items (like your mac's system.defaults)
â””â”€â”€ apps.nix        # GUI application management via Nix and Flatpak (like your mac's homebrew.casks)
```
*(Note: The `ulauncher` fix is now integrated directly into `gnome.nix` and `apps.nix`)*

## 3. Step-by-Step Refactoring Guide

Here is a concrete plan to implement the new architecture.

### Step 1: Create a Unified Installer

To achieve a one-command setup, we'll consolidate all installation logic into a single, robust script. This script will replace `ubuntu/bootstrap.sh` and `ubuntu/install.sh`.

1.  **Delete the old scripts:**
    ```bash
    rm ubuntu/bootstrap.sh
    ```
    You should also remove the `apps` output from your `ubuntu/flake.nix`, as application installation will now be handled declaratively by Home Manager and `flatpak-nix`.

2.  **Create `ubuntu/install.sh`:**
    Replace the content of `ubuntu/install.sh` with this unified script. It's designed to be idempotent and can be run on a fresh Ubuntu system.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    # This script bootstraps the declarative Ubuntu setup.
    # It can be run directly from GitHub:
    # wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlcurrall/setup/main/ubuntu/install.sh | bash

    print_step() {
        echo -e "\nðŸš€ $1"
    }

    # 0. Install essential dependencies
    # We need git to clone the repo and curl to download installers.
    print_step "Installing essential dependencies (git, curl)..."
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install -y git curl

    # 1. Install Nix
    if ! command -v nix &> /dev/null; then
        print_step "Installing Nix package manager..."
        # Using the Determinate Systems installer for its reliability and speed.
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
        # Source the nix profile to make the 'nix' command available in this script session.
        . /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh
    else
        echo "âœ… Nix is already installed."
    fi

    # 2. Enable Flakes (idempotent)
    print_step "Enabling Nix Flakes support..."
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/nix"
    # Check if the feature is already enabled to avoid unnecessary writes
    if ! grep -q "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" "$HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> "$HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf"
    fi

    # 3. Clone or update the setup repository
    SETUP_DIR="$HOME/.setup"
    if [ ! -d "$SETUP_DIR" ]; then
        print_step "Cloning setup repository..."
        git clone https://github.com/rlcurrall/setup.git "$SETUP_DIR"
    else
        print_step "Setup repository already exists. Pulling latest changes..."
        cd "$SETUP_DIR"
        git pull
    fi

    # 4. Build the Home Manager configuration
    print_step "Applying the declarative Home Manager configuration..."
    cd "$SETUP_DIR/ubuntu"
    nix run home-manager/master -- switch --flake .#robb

    echo -e "\nâœ… Setup complete! Please restart your shell or log out and back in for all changes to take effect."
    ```

### Step 2: Update and Modularize Your Flake

Replace your `ubuntu/flake.nix` with this modular version. It adds `flatpak-nix` for declarative Flatpak management.

```nix
{
  description = "Home Manager configuration for Robb on Ubuntu";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    flatpak-nix.url = "github:gmodena/flatpak-nix";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, flatpak-nix, ... }: {
    homeConfigurations.robb = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;
      modules = [
        # Import our modular configuration files
        ./home.nix
        ./gnome.nix
        ./apps.nix

        # Enable declarative flatpak support
        flatpak-nix.homeManagerModules.flatpak
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Module Files

Create the new `.nix` files in the `ubuntu/` directory.

**`ubuntu/apps.nix`** (Manages all applications, like `homebrew` in your Mac flake)

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  # Nix-native packages (mostly CLI tools and essential apps)
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    # Core CLI Tools (from your Mac config)
    zsh git jq ripgrep fzf bat atuin fd zellij starship mise zoxide
    gh pulumi sst azure-functions-core-tools powershell

    # Development Runtimes & Tools
    uv zig rustup just dotnet-sdk

    # System & Utility Tools
    btop vim neovim lazygit lazydocker ffmpeg docker tailscale

    # AI/ML Tools
    llama-cpp ollama

    # Essential GUI apps that work well from nixpkgs
    ghostty
    flameshot
    ulauncher # We install it here
    rider # JetBrains Rider IDE
  ];

  # Flatpak for GUI apps (the equivalent of homebrew casks)
  services.flatpak.packages = [
    # Browsers & Communication
    { appId = "com.google.Chrome"; }
    { appId = "com.vivaldi.Vivaldi"; }
    { appId = "com.discordapp.Discord"; }
    { appId = "us.zoom.Zoom"; }

    # Development & Productivity
    { appId = "com.visualstudio.code"; }
    { appId = "com.cursor.Cursor"; }
    { appId = "dev.zed.Zed"; }
    { appId = "com.claude.Claude"; }
    { appId = "com.usebruno.Bruno"; } # API Client
    { appId = "io.dbeaver.DBeaverCommunity"; } # Database GUI (alternative to TablePlus)
    { appId = "com.1password.1Password"; }
    { appId = "org.localsend.localsend_app"; }

    # Creative & Gaming
    { appId = "com.github.PintaProject.Pinta"; }
    { appId = "com.obsproject.Studio"; }
    { appId = "com.mojang.Minecraft"; }
    { appId = "com.valvesoftware.Steam"; }
  ];

  # Create .desktop files for terminal apps to launch them from the app grid
  xdg.desktopEntries = {
    "Neovim" = {
      name = "Neovim";
      comment = "Edit text files";
      exec = "ghostty -e nvim %F";
      terminal = false;
      icon = "nvim";
      categories = [ "Utility" "TextEditor" "Development" ];
    };
    "Activity" = {
      name = "Activity";
      comment = "System activity from btop";
      exec = "ghostty -e btop";
      terminal = false;
      icon = "utilities-system-monitor";
      categories = [ "Utility" "System" ];
    };
    "LazyDocker" = {
      name = "Docker";
      comment = "Manage Docker containers with LazyDocker";
      exec = "ghostty -e lazydocker";
      terminal = false;
      # You may need to install a docker icon for this to look right
      icon = "docker";
      categories = [ "Utility" "System" "Development" ];
    };
  };
}
```

**`ubuntu/gnome.nix`** (Manages GNOME, like `system.defaults` in your Mac flake)

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  # == THEMES & APPEARANCE ==
  # This section handles the visual look and feel of your desktop.
  gtk = {
    enable = true;
    font = {
      name = "FiraCode Nerd Font";
      size = 10;
    };
    theme = {
      name = "Tokyonight-B-Dark"; # Omakub's default theme
      package = pkgs.tokyo-night-gtk-theme;
    };
    iconTheme = {
      name = "Papirus-Dark";
      package = pkgs.papirus-icon-theme;
    };
  };

    tokyo-night-gtk-theme

  programs.home-manager.enable = true;
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Installer

After creating these files and deleting the old ones, run the new `ubuntu/install.sh` script. Home Manager will build the new, modular configuration. Your system will now be managed in a way that is directly analogous to your Mac setup, resolving the `ulauncher` issue and giving you a clean, powerful, and declarative foundation.
